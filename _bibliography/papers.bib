  abstract = {Individuals vary considerably in how much they earn during their lifetimes. This study examines the role of the tax-and-transfer system in mitigating such inequalities, which could otherwise lead to disparities in living standards. Utilizing a life-cycle model, we determine that the tax-and-transfer system offsets 45% of lifetime earnings inequality attributed to differences in productive abilities and education. Additionally, the system insures against 47% of lifetime earnings risk. Implementing a lifetime tax reform that links annual taxes to prior employment could enhance the systemâ€™s insurance function, though it may involve tradeoffs in terms of employment and overall welfare.},
